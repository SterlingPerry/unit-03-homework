      <h1>Sterling Perry</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Sterling Perry is a multifaceted entrepreneur on track to building a digital marketing empire.Evidence of his unshakable
        self-belief he launched his company just a month shy of graduation. His college lecturer introduced him to his very
        first client. Since then the digital marketing guru has garnered years of experience in web design, marketing, mobile
        apps and digital branding with Georgia’s top companies. He is also an in-demand and sought after public speaker.
        Perry, founder and president of Sent Media Marketing, says it is essential for businesses to have a web presence.
        “It’s critical. If your business doesn’t have a digital presence in 2015 then you don’t have a business.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>"The first place people go is either their phone or tablet when they’re looking for something. If they can’t find
        you there, they can’t find you anywhere, because they’re not going to go the extra step to look for you.” His mobile-friendly
        websites are highlighted by a clean design aesthetic, which has attracted a number of clients, including Murrells,
        UrbanGeekz and the Urban League of Greater Atlanta. Perry’s work is extensive, often including logo designs, social
        media marketing, search engine optimization and even website hosting. Still, web development is just one facet of
        Sent Media. Perry, now 30, sees his Georgia-based company focusing on digital marketing as his firm continues to
        expand.
